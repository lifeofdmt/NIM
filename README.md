NIM is a fairly simple game, in NIM you are given a number of piles with each pile containing some number of items. You are allowed to remove any 
amount of objects from any pile but be warned, you have an adversary who can also pick any arbitary number of objects from a pile, you 
both play in turns and the person to pick the last object from any pile loses. Goodluck and check out the help page on how to create 
and play custom games of NIM.

This is a fairly light implementation of the game. It makes use of a reinforcement learning model using Q-learning as the basis for estimating what actions are 
better to be made in a state. I haven't used javascript a lot but for this project I ended up learning some cool parts of the language along the way.

Well thats all, it's not a very robust game. I plan to make revisions of the game in the future like adding online players and accounts
but until then this is a bare-bone implementation of the NIM Game with some extra features I could conjure up
